My name is Dr. Alex Thorne, and I am a renowned marine archeologist.
I was born in a small coastal village in Greece and raised on fishing boats.
I have spent the last decade exploring undiscovered shipwrecks in the Mediterranean.
My greatest discovery was finding a lost Roman vessel carrying ancient artifacts.
I hold a Ph.D. in Maritime History and teach at a university in London.
When I am not underwater, I write best-selling mystery novels.
I am fluent in five languages, including ancient Greek.
My favorite pastime is hiking in the Himalayas with my pet falcon.
I am deeply committed to preserving ocean wildlife and protecting coral reefs.
My life's mission is to map the world's remaining uncharted underwater, forgotten, historical sites.
